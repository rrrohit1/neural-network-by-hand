# Building a NN from scratch

In this implemenetation, I will be implementing a one-hidden-layer neural network for classification. 

Libraries to be used:
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Scikit-learn's digit datatset

The implementation will be composed of different python scripts for the following functionalities:
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Forward step
- Backward propogation
